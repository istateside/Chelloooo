A Trello clone made with Rails and Backbone.js

Allows for creation of separate boards and lists, with a modal to display checklist items from individual cards.

Drag-and-drop sorting of both lists and cards enabled using jQueryUI's sortable widget.

Coming soon: 
  -highlighting incorrect text-fields upon failed validation
  -inviting other users to see and use your board.
